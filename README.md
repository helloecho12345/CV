## Esther Cho

Enthusiastic and collaborative graduate of Makers Academy looking for a fulfilling, supportive, and engaging junior developer role

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Quick Learner** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers Academy course, including producing our two week final project in Python and Pygame with no prior experience.
- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. I have worked with various levels of stakeholders from Chief Executives to nurses to admins, as well as various backgrounds from architects to research professors. I'm able to work within limited resources, be it people or material resources.
- **Creative** - Coming from a hard science and social science background, with interests in the arts, I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving and always try to consider different perspectives of a problem.
- **Inquisitive** - I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship. I try to attend as many learning events as I can to learn about how tech can be applied in different situations.
- **Attention to detail** - From presentations to missing semi-colons, I can find that random 's' if I have to.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I love the ideation process of a project and dreaming of what can be. 
- **Team-player** - I've had to work with team members from all sorts of backgrounds and working collaboratively towards a shared goal drives quicker success. Having recently attended a hackathon, our team attempted to use a framework with limited knowledge of it, and although the project needs further work, the enthusiasm of each team member helped us work together with agility.
- **Commitment** - I completed the 3 months of Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline, focus and commitment.

## Interests

As a career changer and new to the tech industry, I'm keen to learn and absorb what I can. I've been exploring the vast reaches of tech and have used conferences as a way to network, connect, and learn:


* Big Data London
* Uncodebar
* Microsoft Build
* [Developers Week Conference Europe 2022][4]
* [Women in Tech Global Conference 2022][5]
* [Codeland 2022][13]

I attended my first hackathon!

* [Athena Hackathon 2022][3]

I've been joining organisations and meetups to build my knowledge base and meet fellow developers:

* [Data Engineers London][14]

* [GDG London][8]
* [PyData London][9]
