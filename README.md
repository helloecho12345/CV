## Esther Cho

Graduate of Makers Academy looking for a fun, fulfilling, supportive junior developer role

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Quick Learner** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers Academy course, including producing our two week final project in Python and Pygame with no prior experience.
- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. I have worked with various levels of stakeholders from Chief Executives to nurses to admins, as well as various backgrounds from architects to research professors.
- **Creative** - Coming from a hard science and social science background, with interests in the arts, I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving.
- **Inquisitive** - I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.
- **Attention to detail** - From presentations to missing semi-colons, the details of a project can speak volumes or with code, possibly not at all.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. The start of a new project is always fun and working through the problems so satisfying.
- **Team-player** - I've had to work with team members from all sorts of backgrounds and working collaboratively towards a shared goal drives quicker success.
- **Commitment** - I completed the 3 months of Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline, focus and commitment.
